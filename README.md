# Pharmaceutical Drug Treatments Results

## Background
As a senior data analyst at the company Pymaceuticals, I've been asked to generate all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the study. The executive team also has asked for a top-level summary of the study results. I have been given an access to the complete data from their most recent animal study where 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens.

## Observations and Insights
- [ ] The bar graph shows that the drug regimen Capomulin was tested on the maximum number of mice (230), followed by Ramicane (228).
- [ ] The male and female mice population was very close- 125 male, and 124 female mice in the study. This shows a balanced gender population.
- [ ] From statistics table and box plot, we can infer that Capomulin and Ramicane treatments were more effective than the other drugs.
- [ ] Study of Capomulin drug on randomly selected mouse (ID="s185") shows positive results where the total tumor volume declines over the period of the study.
- [ ] The correlation between mouse weight and average tumor volume is 0.84. This shows that when the mouse weight increases the average tumor volume also increases.
- [ ] The regression analysis shows how much the average tumor volume (dependent variable) will change when weight of the mouse changes (independent variable), with positive slope of the regression line. It also shows that the 70% of the model fits the data. This will help to predict the future studies.
